# How to Get Unbanned on Helldivers 2 (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Helldivers 2 can feel like being kicked out of the galaxy’s best co-op squad — especially if you think it was a glitch in the Matrix. This quick and friendly guide will help you figure out why you got banned and how to appeal that ban for your best shot at rejoining the elite Helldivers.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did the ban hit you hard right after you rolled a fresh Helldiver account? Or is it haunting all your new attempts like an annoying space ghost? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This is when Helldivers 2’s anti-cheat locks onto your PC hardware – making it tougher to get back in, even with brand-new accounts.

Using an HWID spoofer can be your secret weapon to sneak back into the action if your gear got blacklisted.
